== Notes

This particular example uses Cassandra & its reactive drivers in Spring Data, but MongoDB or Couchbase can be easiy substituted (esp Mongo) by removing the Cassandra-specific configuration settings in application.properties and changing the Coffee class's annotations as such:

. Replace @Table with @Document for Mongo
. Replace @PrimaryKey (on the id property) with @Id for Mongo
